## Installation

### Prerequisites

- C / C++ Compiler (Developed and tested using GCC 5.4, Clang / Clang++, and MSVC)
- GNU Make Utility (Linux / MacOS)
- Visual Studio (Windows)

### Clone

- Clone this repo to your local machine using `https://github.com/tstword/MIPSAssemblerC`

### Setup

#### Ubuntu
```shell
$ sudo apt-get install gcc make
```

#### MacOS
```shell
$ xcode-select --install
```

#### Windows
- Since there is no convenient way to get a C compiler on Windows, we will default to using a C++ compiler.
- Fear not, the assembler was written to be compatible with Microsoft's MSVC compiler shipped with Visual Studio. 

<a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">Download Visual Studio</a>.

## Compilation

### Linux / Mac OS
- Change into the directory containing the source code
```shell
$ cd MIPSAssembler
```
- Compile using the Make Utility
```shell
$ make
```
### Windows
1. Open Visual Studio and create an Empty Project (C++)
2. Import the source files into the 'Source Files' folder in the project
3. Change project properties to add the include path containing the header files
4. Build project for target platform (x86/x64)

## Usage

### Provided main program
- Typical usage
```shell
$ bin/assembler program.asm -o program.obj
```
- Dump text segment (binary format)
```shell
$ bin/assembler -a program.asm -t text.dump
```
- Dump data segment (binary format)
```shell
$ bin/assembler -a program.asm -d text.dump
```
- Usage statement
```
$ bin/assembler -h
Usage: bin/assembler [-a] [-h] [-t output] [-d output] [-o output] file...
A MIPS assembler written in C

The following options may be used:
  -a                   Only assembles program, does not create object code file
                       * Note: This does not disable segment dumps
  -d <output>          Stores data segment in <output>
  -h                   Displays this message
  -t <output>          Stores text segment in <output>
  -o <output>          Stores object code in <output>
                       * Note: If this option is not specified, <output> defaults to a.obj

Refer to the repository at <https://github.com/tstword/MIPSAssemblerC>
```

### Using source code
Should you decide to use the assembler in your own main program, here is an example
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "assembler.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    const char *program_files[] = {"program1.asm", "program2.asm"};
    
    struct assembler *assembler = create_assembler();
    
    /* Execute and check to see if the assembler failed to parse the files */
    if(execute_assembler(assembler, program_files, 2) != ASSEMBLER_STATUS_OK) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed to assembler program\n");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
    
    /**
     * The binary data for the segments are referenced by: assembler->segment_memory[SEGMENT]
     * The number of bytes stored is indicated by: assembler->segment_memory_offset[SEGMENT]
     * where SEGMENT equals: SEGMENT_TEXT, SEGMENT_DATA, SEGMENT_KTEXT, or SEGMENT_KDATA 
     *
     * Example: Dumping the data segment 
     **/
     
     printf("Dumping data segment...");
     
     for(int i = 0; i < assembler->segment_memory_offset[SEGMENT_DATA]; i++) {
        /* If offset is a multiple of 4, print address */
        if((i & (0x3)) == 0) printf("\n0x%08X  ", i);
        
        /* Print the byte located at the offset */
        printf("\\%02X ", *((unsigned char *)assembler->segment_memory[SEGMENT_DATA] + i));
     }
     
     printf("\nFinished!\n");
     
     /* Free up the memory used by the assembler */
     destroy_assembler(&assembler);
     
     return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

## Features

### Custom object files
If the program has been successfully assembled, the assembler will produce a custom object file using the structures defined in the file mipsfhdr.h:
```C
struct MIPS_file_header {
    uint8_t m_magic[4];
    uint8_t m_endianness;
    uint8_t m_version;
    uint8_t m_shnum;
    uint8_t m_padding[1];
};

struct MIPS_sect_header {
    uint8_t sh_segment;
    uint8_t sh_padding[3];
    uint32_t sh_offset;
    uint32_t sh_size;
};
```

Each object file created by the assembler contains a file header that is 8 bytes long

Field        | Meaning       | Value
------------ | ------------- | ------------
m_magic | Magic number | "MIPS"
m_endianness | Indicates endianness of system | 0x01 (little-endian)<br />0x02 (big-endian)
m_version | Version the object file was assembled in | 0x01
m_shnum | The number of section headers in the file | Situational
m_padding | Unused data for padding | 0x00

Following the file header is the section header of the first segment. Each section header is 12 bytes long

Field        | Meaning       | Value
------------ | ------------- | ------------
sh_section | The ID of the segment | 0x00 (.text)<br />0x01 (.data)<br />0x02 (.ktext)<br />0x03 (.kdata)
sh_padding | Unused data for padding | 0x00
sh_offset | The file offset in bytes where the header starts | Situational
sh_size | The number of bytes in the segment | Situational

Following the section header are the bytes of the segment itself indicated by sh_section. The next section header (if it exists) can be located using sh_size.

### Support for the core arithmetic instruction set

The assembler supports the instruction set listed here: <a href="http://www.mrc.uidaho.edu/mrc/people/jff/digital/MIPSir.html">http://www.mrc.uidaho.edu/mrc/people/jff/digital/MIPSir.html</a>
