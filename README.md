# C MIPS Assembler
A MIPS assembler written in C. Out of sheer impatience I began work on this project during my free time
as a grader for I&CS 51 at the University of California, Irvine. Why? The MARS simulator is wonderful
IDE however, it takes forever to load into memory and execute. Normally this isn't an issue but because
I had to run scripts on over 150+ submissions and each submission took about ~3 minutes to execute all ~40 test cases
I sought out to create a MIPS assembler in C for faster results.

# Prequisites
C compiler
